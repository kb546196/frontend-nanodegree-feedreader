# Feed Reader Testing

This is a project is for the [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). The aim of the project is to introduce students to unit testing using Jasmine. 

The project began with a pre-existing a web-based application which reads RSS feeds. Students had to amend the `feedreader.js` file to write tests to check  the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

### Getting started
To run the application, clone this repository and open index.html with your browser of choice.

Once the page has loaded Jasmine should appear in a bar at the bottom, which should be green and with 0 failures. If a spec has not passed, Jamsmine will inform the user which spec have not passed within the bar.

Also, it should be noted, that at times when I was stuck the [Udacity forums](https://discussions.udacity.com/c/nd001-website-optimization/website-optimization-project) were a vital resource
