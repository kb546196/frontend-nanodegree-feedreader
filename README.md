### Getting started
To run the application, clone this repository and open index.html with your browser of choice.

Once the page has loaded Jasmine should appear in a bar at the bottom, which should be green and with 0 failures. If a spec has not passed, Jamsmine will inform the user which spec have not passed within the bar.

Also, it should be noted, that at times when I was stuck the [Udacity forums](https://discussions.udacity.com/c/nd001-website-optimization/website-optimization-project) were a vital resource
